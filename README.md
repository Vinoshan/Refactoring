# Refactoring

## Description

Too understand how to right more cleaner code, I was given this website to refactor it. By refactoring I was able to make the HTML more semantic giving meaning behind the "divs",
Learning to consolidating CSS tags, code is shorter and looks more clean. Although I did not build this project, it was very insightful on how the real world is when you are hired
to optimize code which will help other programmers to read your or the companies code.
